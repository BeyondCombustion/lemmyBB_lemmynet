# lemmyBB

A Lemmy frontend inspired by [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/).

## Development

Follow the instructions for [Local Lemmy Development](https://join-lemmy.org/docs/en/contributing/local_development.html). You need the Lemmy backend source code and a cargo installation, along with PostgreSQL. Lemmy-ui is not necessary, but can be useful for testing.

Once the development setup is ready, execute `cargo run` in both the lemmy and lemmyBB directories.
